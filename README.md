## Biography

![Profile Picture](./assets/Head.jpg)

Hello! I’m Altia Gonzales Inale from Bicol, Philippines. I am a curious and open-minded person who likes learning at my own pace and exploring different experiences. I try to approach challenges with patience and take things one step at a time.  I am currently a 3rd-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Information Systems. While I am still figuring out my strengths in this field, I continue to attend my classes and complete my coursework. I focus on doing my best and learning gradually, even if the subject isn’t my main passion. Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading, watching Thai movies, and following comics. These hobbies help me balance my time and stay motivated in my personal life.
